# openscad-cable-guide
This is a cable guide developed in OpenSCAD. It is a parametric model. It is a work in progress.

The design is intended to be self explanatory.
It opens with a module that generates a single cable slot cell, with paramatized dimensions.

That is followed by a set of parameters to define a cell that is a 50mm cube (about two inches).
That is followed by a generator loop that currently defaults to 10 cells.

I intend to carry this forward with additional features, but here is the start, and your are welcome to it.

Feel free to clone, and if you would like to fancy it up, and issue a PR request, I'll certainly consider submissions.

I am just learning OpenSCAD, so I will also accept any constructive criticism.
